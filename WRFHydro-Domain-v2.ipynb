    "1. going to subset.cuahsi.org\n",
    "2. selecting location of interest and request subset\n",
    "3. downloading data via wget\n",
    "4. inspecting the content\n"

    "## 2. Background\n",
    "The purpose of this application is to introduce a collaborative effort for preparing, publishing, and sharing subsets of the National Water Model input data and geo-fabric at watershed scales. Our hope is that these efforts will lower the barrier of entry for using and applying these models and engage a wide variety scientists from a diverse spectrum of expertise. With a combination of modern cyberinfrastructure techniques and state-of-the-science modeling tools, researchers will have access to subsets of National Water Model information that would otherwise require extensive computational resources. This work provides the foundation onto which similar efforts can be applied to other large-scale model simulations and input data."
